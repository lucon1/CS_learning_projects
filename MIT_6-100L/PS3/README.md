Collaboration
Students may work together, but each student should write up and hand in their assignment separately. Students may not submit the exact same
code.
Students are not permitted to look at or copy each other’s code or code structure.
Include the names of your collaborators in comment at the start of each file.
Please refer to the collaboration policy in the Course Information for more details.
Although this handout is long, the information is here to provide you with context, useful examples, and hints, so be sure to read carefully.
A) File Setup
Download the file 1_ps3.zip and extract all files to the same directory. The files included are: document_distance.py, test_ps3_student.py, and
various documents of texts and lyrics within the tests/student_tests directory. When you are done, make sure you run the tester file
test_ps3_student.py to check your code against some of our test cases.
You will edit ONLY document_distance.py.
B) Document Distance Overview
Given two words or documents, you will calculate a score between 0 and 1 that will tell you how similar they are. If the words or documents are the
same, they will get a score of 1. If the documents are completely different, they will get a score of 0. You will calculate the score in two different ways
and observe whether one works better than the other. The first way will use single word frequencies in the two texts. The second will use the TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) of words in a file.
Note that you do NOT need to worry about case sensitivity throughout this pset. All inputs will be lower case.
1) Text to List
The first step in any data analysis problem is prepping your data. We have provided a function called load_file to read a text file and output all the
text in the file into a string. This function takes in a variable called filename, which is a string of the filename you want to load, including the extension.
It removes all punctuation, and saves the text as a string. Do not modify this function.
Here’s an example usage:
1
# hello_world.txt looks like this: 'hello world, hello'
>>> text = load_file("tests/student_tests/hello_world.txt")
>>> text
'hello world hello'
You will further prepare the text by taking the string and transforming it into a list representation of the text. Given the example from above, here is what
we expect:
>>> text_to_list('hello world hello')
[‘hello’, ‘world’, ‘hello’]
Implement text_to_list in document_distance.py as per the given instructions and docstring. In addition to running the tester file, you can quickly
check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at the bottom of
document_distance.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Tests Problem 0: Prep Data
 test_directory = "tests/student_tests/"
 hello_world, hello_friend = load_file(test_directory + 'hello_world.txt'), load_file(test_directory + 'h
 world, friend = text_to_list(hello_world), text_to_list(hello_friend)
print(world) # should print ['hello', 'world', 'hello']
print(friend) # should print ['hello', 'friends']
Note: You can assume that the only kinds of white space in the text documents we provide will be new lines or space(s) between words (i.e.
there are no tabs).
2) Get Frequencies
Let’s start by calculating the frequency of each element in a given list. The goal is to return a dictionary with each unique element as the key, and the
number of times the element occurs in the list as the value.
Consider the following examples:
Example 1:
>>> get_frequencies(['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'])
{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
Example 2:
>>> get_frequencies(['hello', 'world', 'hello'])
{'hello': 2, 'world': 1}
Implement get_frequencies in document_distance.py using the above instructions and the docstring provided. In addition to running the tester file,
you can quickly check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at the bottom of
document_distance.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Tests Problem 1: Get Frequencies
 test_directory = "tests/student_tests/"
 hello_world, hello_friend = load_file(test_directory + 'hello_world.txt'), load_file(test_directory + 'h
 world, friend = text_to_list(hello_world), text_to_list(hello_friend)
 world_word_freq = get_frequencies(world)
 friend_word_freq = get_frequencies(friend)
print(world_word_freq) # should print {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}
print(friend_word_freq) # should print {'hello': 1, 'friends': 1}
3) Letter Frequencies
2
Now, given a word in the form of a string, let's create a dictionary with each letter as the key and how many times each letter occurs in the word as the
value. That sounds very similar to get_frequencies...
You must call get_frequencies in your get_letter_frequencies to get full credit.
Example 1:
>>> get_letter_frequencies('hello')
{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
Example 2:
>>> get_letter_frequencies('that')
{'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'a': 1}
Implement get_letter_frequencies in document_distance.py using the above instructions and the docstring provided. In addition to running the
tester file, you can quickly check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at the
bottom of document_distance.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Tests Problem 2: Get Letter Frequencies
 freq1 = get_letter_frequencies('hello')
 freq2 = get_letter_frequencies('that')
print(freq1) # should print {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
print(freq2) # should print {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'a': 1}
4) Similarity
Now it’s time to calculate similarity! Complete the function calculate_similarity_score based on the definition of similarity found in the next
paragraph. Your function should be able to be used with the outputs of get_frequencies or get_letter_frequencies.
Consider two lists and . Let be a list made up of all the elements in or , but with no repeats (e.g. if
, then ). For an element in or , let
We can then define:
(where the vertical bars denote absolute value), and
.
Similarity is defined as:
where the sums are taken over all the elements of , and the result is rounded to two decimal places.
Example (where elements are words):
Suppose
, and
.
The list of unique elements is .
The frequency differences are
The frequency totals are
L1 L2 U L1 L2 L1 = [‘a’, ‘b’],L2 =
[‘b’, ‘c’] U = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’] e L1 L2
count(e,Li) = {
number of times e appears in Li
0
if e in L ,i
 if e not in L .i
δ(e) = ∣count(e,L1) − count(e,L2)∣
σ(e) = count(e,L1) + count(e,L2)
1 −
σ(u1 2 3 ) + σ(u ) + σ(u ) + ...
δ(u1 2 3 ) + δ(u ) + δ(u ) + ...
u1 2 3 , u , u , ... U
L1 = [‘hello’, ‘world’, ‘hello’]
L2 = [‘hello’, ‘friends’]
U U = [‘hello’, ‘world’, ‘friends’]
δ(u)
δ(‘hello’) = ∣2 − 1∣ = 1
δ(‘world’) = ∣1 − 0∣ = 1
δ(‘friends’) = ∣0 − 1∣ = 1
σ(u)
3
Thus, similarity is ( rounded to two decimal places is still ).
The same calculation with an alternate (but equivalent) explanation can be found in the calculate_similarity_score's docstring.
IMPORTANT: Be sure to round your final similarity calculation to 2 decimal places.
Implement the function calculate_similarity_score in document_distance.py with the given instruction and docstrings. In addition to running
the tester file, you can quickly check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at
the bottom of document_distance.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Tests Problem 3: Similarity
 test_directory = "tests/student_tests/"
 hello_world, hello_friend = load_file(test_directory + 'hello_world.txt'), load_file(test_directory + 'h
 world, friend = text_to_list(hello_world), text_to_list(hello_friend)
 world_word_freq = get_frequencies(world)
 friend_word_freq = get_frequencies(friend)
 word1_freq = get_letter_frequencies('toes')
 word2_freq = get_letter_frequencies('that')
 word3_freq = get_frequencies('nah')
 word_similarity1 = calculate_similarity_score(word1_freq, word1_freq)
 word_similarity2 = calculate_similarity_score(word1_freq, word2_freq)
 word_similarity3 = calculate_similarity_score(word1_freq, word3_freq)
 word_similarity4 = calculate_similarity_score(world_word_freq, friend_word_freq)
print(word_similarity1) # should print 1.0
print(word_similarity2) # should print 0.25
print(word_similarity3) # should print 0.0
print(word_similarity4) # should print 0.4
5) Most Frequent Word(s)
Next, you will find out which word(s) occurs the most frequently among two dictionaries. You'll count how many times every word occurs combined
across both texts and return a list of the most frequent word(s). The most frequent word does not need to appear in both dictionaries. It is based
on the combined word frequencies across both dictionaries. If a word occurs in both dictionaries, consider the sum of frequencies as the combined
word frequency. If multiple words are tied (i.e. have the same highest frequency), return an alphabetically ordered list of all these words.
For example, consider the following usage:
>>> freq1 = {"hello": 5, "world": 1}
>>> freq2 = {"hello": 1, "world": 5}
>>> get_most_frequent_words(freq1, freq2)
["hello", "world"]
Implement the function get_most_frequent_words in document_distance.py as per the given instructions and docstring. In addition to running the
tester file, you can quickly check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at the
bottom of document_distance.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Tests Problem 4: Most Frequent Word(s)
 freq_dict1, freq_dict2 = {"hello": 5, "world": 1}, {"hello": 1, "world": 5}
 most_frequent = get_most_frequent_words(freq_dict1, freq_dict2)
print(most_frequent) # should print ["hello", "world"]
6) Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
In this part, you will calculate the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency, which is a numerical measure that signifies the importance of
word(s) in a document. You will do so by first calculating the term frequency and inverse document frequency, then combine the two together to get
δ(‘hello’) = 2 + 1 = 3
δ(‘world’) = 1 + 0 = 1
δ(‘friends’) = 0 + 1 = 1
1 − 3+1+1 =
1+1+1 1 − 5 =
3 0.4 0.4 0.4
4
the TF-IDF.
The term frequency (TF) is calculated as:
The inverse document frequency (IDF) is calculated as:
where is log base 10 and can be called with math.log10.
We can then combine TF and IDF to form , where the higher the value, the rarer the term and vice versa. For this
pset, we'll only be working with individual words, but TF-IDF works for larger groupings of words as well (e.g. bigrams, trigrams, etc.).
For the get_tf function that you'll implement, you'll be given a file name stored in a variable named text_file. You will need to load the file, prep the
data, and determine the TF value of each word that appears in text_file. The output should be a dictionary mapping each word to its TF. Think
about how you could re-use previous functions.
For the get_idf function that you'll implement, you'll be given a list of text files stored in a variable named text_files. You will need to load each of
the files, prep the data, and determine the IDF values of all words that appear in any of the documents in text_files. The output should be a
dictionary mapping each word to its IDF.
For the get_tfidf function that you'll implement, you'll be given a file name text_file and a list of file names text_files. You will need to load
the file, prep the data, and determine the TF-IDF of all words in text_file. The output should be a sorted list of tuples (in increasing TF-IDF score),
where each tuple is of the form (word, TF-IDF). In case of words with the same TF-IDF, the words should be sorted in increasing alphabetical order.
For example,
>>> text_file = "tests/student_tests/hello_world.txt"
>>> get_tf(text_file)
{"hello": 0.6666666666666666, "world": 0.3333333333333333}
# Explanation: There are 3 total words in "hello_world.txt". 2 of the three total words are "hello", giving
>>> text_files = ["tests/student_tests/hello_world.txt", "tests/student_tests/hello_friends.txt"]
>>> get_idf(text_files)
{"hello": 0.0, "world": 0.3010299956639812, "friends": 0.3010299956639812}
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 documents in this example. "hello" is in both documents, giving "hello
>>> text_file = "tests/student_tests/hello_world.txt"
>>> text_files = ["tests/student_tests/hello_world.txt", "tests/student_tests/hello_friends.txt"]
>>> get_tfidf(text_file, text_files)
[('hello', 0.0), ('world', 0.10034333188799373)]
# Explanation: We multiply the corresponding TF and IDF values for each word in "hello_world.txt" and get th
Implement the functions get_tf, get_idf, and get_tfidf in document_distance.py as per the given instructions. In addition to running the tester
file, you can quickly check your implementation on the provided examples for each problem by uncommenting the relevant lines of code at the bottom

 idf = get_idf(idf_text_files)
 tf_idf = get_tfidf(tf_text_file, idf_text_files)
print(tf) # should print {'hello': 0.6666666666666666, 'world': 0.3333333333333333}

Supplemental Reading about Document Similarity
This pset is a greatly simplified version of a very pertinent problem in Information Retrieval. Applications of document similarity range from retrieving
search engine results to comparing genes and proteins to improving machine translation.
More advanced techniques to calculating document distance include transforming the text into a vector space and computing the cosine similarity,
Jaccard Index, or some other metric of the vectors.
