Problem Set 5: Using Libraries
Pset Buddy
You do not have a buddy assigned for this pset.
Introduction
The problem set will introduce you to the topic of library use, that is, using existing libraries in order to accomplish a goal. This problem set involves
writing very little code; the learning process is finding useful functions that do the work for you in the existing libraries. You are expected to make use of
web search to locate the necessary functions.
Collaboration:
You may work with other students. However, each student should write up and hand in his or her assignment separately. Be sure to indicate with whom
you have worked in the comments of your submission.
Note on Grading:
This assignment will have a higher weight to the manual grading as the autograder is not as extensive. 50% of the grade will be from the autograder and
50% will be from manually grading the produced images.
The tester test_ps5_student.py will help you determine if you are revealing the hidden images correctly.
1) Colorblindness Filters
The human eye contains two types of photoreceptive (light sensitive) cells: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light environments,
such as at night, and cones are responsible for color vision. There are three types of cones, each responsible for a particular color, that is, red, green
and blue. The red, green and blue cones all work together allowing you to see the whole spectrum of colors. For example, when the red and blue cones
are stimulated in a certain way, you will see the color purple.
The condition known as colorblindness typically manifests as a deficiency in one of these types of cones, for example, protanopia is a lack of sensitivity
to red light, so the following is an example of the difference in viewing an image.
The objective of this part is to create filters to simulate these differences. To do this, we will make use of Python’s Image Library or PIL for short. From
PIL we will import Image, which is a sublibrary, or a set of functions and methods, related to image processing. With Image, we can convert images to
a list of pixels, and manipulate the RGB (red, green, blue) values of these pixels.
We can replicate the effects of colorblindness with a matrix multiplication between a colorblindness transformation matrix and the RGB values of a
particular pixel, which are represented as a vector with 3 entries.

You do not need to know anything about matrix multiplication; however, if you wish to pursue more information on it, see here.
Here is a general breakdown of the image transformation process:
1. Open the image in Python
2. Retrieve a list (of tuples or ints) of the pixel information
3. Iterate through pixels and multiply them by the transformation matrix using matrix_multiply
4. Save transformed pixels as an image
1.1) Implementing Helper Functions
1.1.1) img_to_pix(filename)
The first helper function will be to convert the image to a list of pixels. The input is a string representing an image file, like ‘ example.jpg’, and the
output is a list corresponding to the pixels in that image, e.g.: [(0,0,0),(255,255,255),(38,29,58)...] for RGB, [60, 66, 72...] for BW. The
list will consist of 3-element tuples that correspond to the RGB values of that pixel for a RGB image, or an integer corresponding to the brightness of
that pixel for a BW image.
You'll want to open the image and get the data of that image. (Check the Image module documentation for how to do these things.) Note: Don't
worry about determining if an image is RGB or BW. The PIL library functions you will use return the correct pixel values for either image mode.
This should be very short if you can find the appropriate functions.
1.1.2) pix_to_img(pixels_list, size, mode)
The next helper function is to convert a list of pixels to an image. The input will be pixels_list, in the same format as the output of the previous function,
a size parameter which is a two-element tuple that describes the dimensions of the output image, and a mode parameter which determines whether the
input pixels represent a black and white or a color image. Assume that size is a valid input such that size[0] * size[1] == len(pixels).
In other words, you want to copy pixel values from a sequence object into the image, so you should check the Image module documentation on how
to do this. See the docstring for details on how mode should be represented.
This should be very short if you can find the appropriate functions.
1.1.3) filter(pixels_list, color)
This function takes in a list of pixels in RGB form, such as [(0,0,0),(255,255,255),(38,29,58)...], as well as a color: 'red', 'blue', 'green', or
'none'. The purpose of this function is to apply a transformation to the pixels in the input list that simulate impairment in the cones of the input color.
Return the list of transformed pixels.
In order to do the transformation, multiply each pixel by the appropriate matrix. We have provided a make_matrix function that will supply a matrix
representing the appropriate transformation depending on the input string. For example, make_matrix('red') will return the matrix representing a
red deficiency in one’s vision.
Remember that you must iterate through the list of pixels and multiply each one by the appropriate matrix. Use the provided
matrix_multiply(matrix1, matrix2) method to do this. Please keep in mind that we want the transformation matrix to be the first argument
and the RGB pixel vector to be the second, or else the resulting image will be incorrect. Take note that matrix_multiply returns a list of floats and
that the pixels must be tuples of ints.
This should be fairly short if you can find the appropriate functions.
If all is done correctly, then running the program with the test image (‘image_15.png’) and a red deficiency should result in the following:

The original image The transformed image
Images like these are known as Ishihara tests.
To receive credit, submit the transformed image at the end of the PSet.
2) Hidden Messages in Images
In an image, it is possible to hide a second (secret) image that can only be recovered by certain mathematical operations. This is known as
steganography. In this section, you will go through some examples and write your own steganography module to hide images.
The original image The secret image
An example of steganography is provided above. The image on the left contains the image on the right. When you are done with this problem set, you
will understand how to extract the secret image from the original.
In a black and white image, each pixel is represented by a numerical value that indicates its brightness. The minimum value for each pixel is 0 (which
corresponds to black), while the maximum value (which corresponds to white) depends on the number of bits used for each pixel. In our examples, we
will use 8-bit images. This means the pixels can take values between 0 and 255, inclusive (can you see why?).
For this part, assume you are dealing with images that have 8-bit color depth.
2.1) Working with Binary Numbers
This part of the pset relies on reading and manipulating binary numbers.
As an example, let’s take a look at the binary representation of the decimal number 13, which is 1101. Starting from the rightmost digit in a binary number
and moving left, each index location represents an increasing power of 2:
When we sum up these powers of 2 (i.e. ), we get 13.
For more examples and explanations of binary numbers, see lecture slides from Lecture 3.
2.1.1) Least Significant Bits
The most common technique for embedding secret images is to use the least significant bit (LSB) of each pixel value. We can modify the LSB in each
pixel without making any noticeable difference. This way, an image can carry another secret image that is completely invisible to the naked eye.
What is a least significant bit?
1 1 0 1

3 2

Example: What is the LSB of 13? First convert the decimal representation to binary as shown above: 13 -> 1101.
The LSB is the rightmost digit, in this case a 1. The 3 LSBs are are the two rightmost digits, in this case 101, which is 5 in base 10.
2.1.2) Questions to Consider
Note: these are not part of the assignment, they are merely to help you think through the problem. If you get stuck, post on Piazza or come
into office hours!
1. Given a number is divisible by 2, what would be the value of the LSB? Which of these binary numbers are divisible by 2: 1001, 10111, 10110, 111110?
2. How can we get the value of the LSB without converting a base 10 number into binary representation?
3. Would the binary number xxx00 (x can be either 0 or 1) be divisible by 4? If so why?
4. What would be the remainder of these binary numbers when divided by 4: xxx01, xxx10, xxx11
5. How can we extract the two LSBs of a base 10 number without converting it to binary?
6. How can we extract the n LSBs of a base 10 number without converting it to binary?
Please make sure you understand these questions before moving on. Understanding them will simplify your implementation of
extract_end_bits.
2.2) Implementing extract_end_bits
In order to extract arbitrary numbers of these LSBs from pixel values, you will implement a helper function extract_end_bits(num_end_bits,
pixel). This function will output the num_end_bits LSBs of pixel as an integer in base 10.
Parameters:
num_end_bits: the number of LSBs to return
pixel: the pixel value whose LSBs will be returned
For example, going off of the example above, we could write:
extract_end_bits(1, 13) # get one LSB -> return 1
extract_end_bits(2, 13) # get two LSBs -> return 1
extract_end_bits(3, 13) # get three LSBs -> return 5
Hints:
Do not convert numbers into binary.
The implementation of this function should be very short.
When thinking about how to implement extract_end_bits, the modulo (%) operator may be very useful.
You can run test_ps5_student.py to check your implementation of extract_end_bits.
2.3) Recovering a binary image
In a binary (black & white) image, each pixel is represented by a numerical value representing its intensity. The minimum value for each pixel is 0 (which
corresponds to black), while the maximum value (which corresponds to white) depends on the number of bits used for each pixel. In our examples, we
will use 8-bit images. This means the pixels can take values between 0 and 255, inclusive (can you see why?).
In ps5.py, complete the black and white portion of the function reveal_image by implementing reveal_bw_image according to the docstring. This
function takes in the filename of an image, uses the LSB value to find the hidden image, and returns it as a PIL.Image object.
Note : reveal_image should be able to handle both BW and RGB images; you'll implement the RGB portion in part c.
Important: The hidden image is embedded in the least significant bit and can be recovered using extract_end_bits with the appropriate num_bits
argument on each pixel value. However, using the raw result from this operation will produce an image with very low contrast. Once you recover the
information, you should carry out another operation to rescale the pixel values, so they can make use of the full range of available values.
In the problem set folder, you will find an image named hidden1.bmp. Using your function, find the secret image in this file and save a copy of it by
using the PIL libary functionality. Note: for a grayscale image, the secret image should also be grayscale. Remember what you named the file as you will
need the file name in a bit.
2.3.1) Questions to Consider
4
Note: these are not part of the assignment, they are merely to help you think through the problem. If you get stuck, post on Piazza or come
into office hours!
1. What numbers in base 10 can be represented in 1 bit? In 2 bits?
2. What is the range of values of a BW pixel (or an element in a RGB pixel)?
3. How can we rescale LSB values to take advantage of a pixel's range?
2.4) Recovering a color image
The methods described above are robust enough to be applied to more bits. In this part, you'll work with an RGB image and use three least significant
bits to recover the secret image.
In ps5.py, complete the relevant component of the function reveal_image by implementing reveal_color_image according to its docstring. For a
color image, this function takes in the filename, extracts the secret image from the three least significant bits of each channel (red, green and blue) and
returns it as a PIL.Image object. You will again need to rescale the pixels.
In the problem set folder, you will find an image named hidden2.bmp. Using your function, find the secret image in this file and save a copy of it by
using the PIL libary functionality. Remember what you named the file as you will need the file name in a bit.
2.5) Making Your Art Your Own
At this point you should have three new images:
1. Filtered image_15.png
2. Unhidden hidden1.bmp
3. Unhidden hidden2.bmp
Using the provided helper function draw_kerb, run each of your images through this function to add your kerberos watermark to each one.
To get you started, if you had a image named img1.png and your kerberos was timthebeaver you could call draw_kerb("img1.png",
"timthebeaver)" which would output an image in your directory named img1_kerb.png.
Once you have the three images with your kerb on them, combine them into one pdf for submission. You can use something like a pdf combiner to do
this. You should be able to upload all three in their original file format and it will output one pdf file that you should submit.
NOTE: Before submitting your code to the website, comment out your draw_kerb function calls to avoid breaking the autograder!
